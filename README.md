# German Flashcard

This repository contains a collection of German flashcards created to enhance German language skills. I built it for me and my classmates to learn for our German 1 class, which is the equivalent to half of A1 German syllabus.

The app is built using `create-react-app` and is deployed on Vercel. You can check it out [here](https://deutsch-flashcard.vercel.app/).
